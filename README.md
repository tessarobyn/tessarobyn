### Hi, I'm Tessa! 👋
I'm passionate about front-end design and development, and I'm hoping to branch out into back-end/data visualisation technologies.

#### ⭐ Current Skills
All the fun tech, languages and software I have used over the last five years:

#### 🌱 Skills I'm Learning
Currently I'm focussing on two streams: more design-focussed development using Figma and Blender, as well as data scraping/visualisation in Python using Flask and Selenium.
