### Hi, I'm Tessa!
I'm passionate about front-end design and development, and I'm hoping to branch out into back-end/data visualisation technologies.

**What I'm working on:** Marine life sightings data visualisation using `Selenium` and `Streamlit` <br/>
**What I've recently finished:**&nbsp; Mobile app prototype using `Flutter`, `express.js` and `mysql` <br/>
**What I'm hoping to do next:**&nbsp; Update my portfolio website, which is currently under construction 🚧
<br/>

#### Skills I'm Learning
Currently I'm focussing on two streams: more design-focussed development using Figma and Blender, as well as data scraping/visualisation in Python using Flask and Selenium.
